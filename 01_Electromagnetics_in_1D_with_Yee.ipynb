As a first case, we will ignore electric charges (charged particles) and thus currents and stick to one-dimensional simulations. Later notebooks will extend on the algorithms presented here. "

To make matters even worse, we will not use efficient modules like [`numpy`](https://www.numpy.org/) in order to demonstrate the algorithms clearly and not obfuscate them by writing them as efficient `numpy` function calls.
